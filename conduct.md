#**Club Code of Conduct and Guidelines**

##**TL;DR. ​Be respectful**. 

###**Harassment and Discrimination:**

Harassment and abuse are never tolerated. If you are in a situation that makes you uncomfortable with any Data Science Club event, if the event itself is creating an unsafe or inappropriate environment, or if interacting with a Data Science Club member or officer makes you uncomfortable, please report it to an officer.

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you’re doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it.

Please also do not discriminate members on their ability or academic background, we are all here because it is an environment that encourages learning, especially from each other. 

###**Respecting Speakers:**

At some point in the year we may have guest speakers in addition to student speakers. It's very important to give these people your full attention. If you want to be on your laptop doing something else, that's fine as long as you sit towards the back of the room. Also be courteous and don't speak while they're speaking. Simple stuff, really.

###**Representing the club at outside events:**

If we ever go to hackathons, meetups, or any other external events please follow the guidelines we would have at our internal events and be respectful. This includes any post-event events where we still congregate as a club. We're lucky to have a lot of connections with industry and the local tech scene, and ensuring we're on our best behavior helps strengthens those connections and people's opinion of us.
